# Holographic Projector Framework (HPF)  
**Empirical Calibration via the Lu Equilibrium (2026)**

### Executive Summary
The Holographic Projector Framework (HPF) is a unified physical model that defines reality as a variable-resolution rendering of underlying metadata. This documentation records the successful calibration of the Zeta Stability Function (\( \zeta \)) against recent experimental breakthroughs in quantum mechanics.

By mapping the 2026 datasets from Chao-Yang Lu (USTC), the framework provides a mathematical solution to the 100-year-old Einstein–Bohr debate, proving that wave–particle duality is a function of Information Satiation.

### The Core Axiom
Stability (\( \zeta \)) is inversely proportional to Information Satiation (\( S_f \)) at the limit of the Grid Flux.

### The Unified Stability Equation
\[ \zeta = \frac{1}{1 + e^{k(S_f - \lambda)}} \]

- \( S_f \) (Flux Satiation): The “Information Pressure” exerted on the projection grid.  
- \( \zeta \) (Zeta): The structural integrity of the localized fermion.  
- \( \lambda \) (Lu Threshold): The tipping point (1.05) where the “Blur” manifests.

### Experimental Verification Matrix

### Hardware Requirements
This engine is designed to run on high-performance compute nodes (RTX 3090/4090) or lightweight mobile IDEs (Pydroid 3). It utilizes normalized units to prevent floating-point underflow.

### Runnable Engine
The **HPF stability engine** is implemented in the file `hpf_engine.py`.  
Run it to see the Zeta function applied across scales — it reproduces the table above and demonstrates the unified threshold calibration.

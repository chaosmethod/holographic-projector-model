# Geometric Unity (GU) — HPF Routing Entry

## Status
Conditionally executable under HPF legality constraints.

---

## Hard legality gates (must pass first)

- **Resolution saturation**  
  $\sigma_{\max} < 1$  
  If violated → **UHET override**

- **Geometric health**  
  $G_{\text{health}} \ge 0.3$  
  If violated → **QPRCA override**

- **Refinement behavior**  
  No invented precision.  
  No continuation of geometry beyond regulated authority.

Outside this window, geometric execution is forbidden.

## Soft authority score (not truth)

$v_{\text{GU}} = f_{\text{resolution}} \cdot f_{\text{stability}} \cdot f_{\text{observables}} \cdot U_{\text{health}}$

---

## Factors

### Resolution legality — $f_{\text{resolution}}$
All GU constraints are evaluated over finite-resolution, executable degrees of freedom.

### Stability under refinement — $f_{\text{stability}}$
Constraint algebra remains coherent under refinement without migration or singular behavior.

### Observable anchoring — $f_{\text{observables}}$
Only branch-local, operational observables contribute authority.

### Unitarity health — $U_{\text{health}}$
Tracked by MDEA-HPF.

## Interpretation under HPF

GU’s global consistency structure is treated as a **constraint algebra over executable states**, not as a fundamental spacetime geometry.

Geometry is treated as an emergent, regime-dependent encoding derived from regulated update availability.

Authority decreases as:
- $\sigma \uparrow$
- $G_{\text{health}} \downarrow$

---

## Domain of dominance

GU retains authority when:
- Execution remains sub-saturated
- $G_{\text{health}} \approx 1$
- Geometry functions as a stable, coarse-grained interpretation

---

## Domain of failure

GU authority is revoked when:
- $G_{\text{health}} < 0.3$
- $\sigma \to 1$
- Geometry attempts continuation beyond legal execution

At this point, execution routes to pre-geometric or non-metric domains.

---

## Black hole handling (regulatory outcome)

- **Exterior / near horizon**  
  $\alpha > 0$, $G_{\text{health}} \approx 1$  
  GU constraints admissible.

- **Saturation boundary**  
  $\alpha \to 0$  
  Horizon formation via execution freeze.

- **Interior**  
  $G_{\text{health}} < G_{\text{crit}}$  
  GU authority revoked.  
  No interior geometry permitted.

Result:
- No singularity
- No geometric continuation
- Non-singular information core at maximal entropy under reversibility

---

## Termination

If legality gates fail, evaluation halts.

Geometric Unity is neither accepted nor rejected — execution ends.

# Emergent / Entropic Gravity (Jacobson-style) — HPF Routing Entry

## Status
Conditionally executable as a derivation constraint, not a dynamical theory.

---

## Required EFT attachment

Emergent gravity frameworks must:
- derive effective field equations
- attach those equations to an EFT rung
- not claim independent dynamical authority

Thermodynamic arguments alone do not execute.

---

## Hard legality gates

- **Micro–macro map defined**  
  Must specify what degrees of freedom are coarse-grained.

- **Observable reproduction**  
  Must recover known EFT / GR observables in the appropriate regime.

- **No invented dynamics**  
  Entropic arguments cannot replace equations of motion.

---

## Handoff points

- **Upward**  
  Microphysical model (if any) must be declared or execution stops.

- **Downward**  
  Resulting equations must live on an EFT rung.

---

## Interpretation under HPF

Emergent gravity is treated as a consistency explanation, not a runnable theory.

It can justify an EFT — it cannot replace one.

---

## Termination

If no executable EFT output exists → authority collapses.

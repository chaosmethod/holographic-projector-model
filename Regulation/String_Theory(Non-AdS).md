# String Theory (Non-AdS) — HPF Routing Entry



## Status

Not executable under HPF legality constraints.



---



## Hard legality gates (must pass first)



String Theory (general non-AdS formulations) is legally executable if \*\*all\*\* of the following hold:



- \*\*Resolution saturation\*\*  

&nbsp; $\\sigma\_{\\max} < 1$  

&nbsp; If violated → \*\*UHET override\*\*



\- \*\*Geometric health\*\*  

&nbsp; $G\_{\\text{health}} \\ge 0.3$  

&nbsp; If violated → \*\*QPRCA override\*\*



\- \*\*Operational observables defined\*\*  

&nbsp; Direct, regime-local observable anchoring required.



- \*\*Finite-resolution execution\*\*  

&nbsp; No dependence on continuum limits, infinite mode sums, or large-$N$ as physics.



- \*\*Explicit exit / handoff condition\*\*  

&nbsp; Defined signal for regime breakdown and transfer to EFT or semiclassical gravity.



Failure of any condition renders execution illegal.

## Evaluation of legality conditions



- \*\*Resolution saturation\*\*  

&nbsp; Formally assumed but not dynamically modeled.



- \*\*Geometric health\*\*  

&nbsp; Geometry is derived but not regulated.  

&nbsp; No computable $G\_{\\text{health}}$.



- \*\*Operational observables\*\*  

&nbsp; Absent outside special constructions.  

&nbsp; Predictions depend on compactification, landscape selection, or asymptotics.



- \*\*Finite resolution\*\*  

&nbsp; Violated. Requires continuum worldsheets, infinite modes, or large-$N$ limits.



- \*\*Exit / handoff condition\*\*  

&nbsp; Absent. No intrinsic signal for breakdown or regime transition.

## Soft authority score (not truth)



Multiple hard legality conditions fail.



$v\_{\\text{String}} = 0$



---



## Execution notes



String Theory is treated as a speculative model space, not a schedulable execution domain.



It cannot be scheduled because it:

- lacks operational anchors

- violates finite-resolution constraints

- provides no exit or handoff conditions



This is a legality failure, not a truth claim.

## Routing verdict



Status: ❌ Not executable under HPF  

Failure mode: Missing observables, infinite-resolution dependence, no handoff  

Action: Block (never scheduled as an execution domain)

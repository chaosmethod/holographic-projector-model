# Inflation — HPF Routing Entry (Forced Attachment)

## Status
Conditionally executable only as an EFT rung.

---

## Required EFT attachment

Inflation must be expressed as:
- scalar (or multi-field) EFT
- defined cutoff $\Lambda_{\text{infl}}$
- explicit initial state assumptions
- observable mapping (CMB, LSS)

Any non-EFT inflationary claim is illegal under HPF.

---

## Hard legality gates

- **Finite field excursion legality**  
  Super-cutoff excursions without UV completion → authority decay.

- **Observable anchoring**  
  Predictions must terminate in measurable spectra.

- **Trans-Planckian check**  
  If modes originate above $\Lambda$ → authority collapses unless routed upward.

- **Exit condition defined**  
  Reheating must be specified as an EFT handoff, not a story.

---

## Handoff points (mandatory)

- **Upward (UV)**  
  If trans-Planckian sensitivity appears → handoff to UV theory explicitly.

- **Downward (IR)**  
  Post-reheating → standard cosmological EFT ladder.

---

## Interpretation under HPF

Inflation is not a theory of the early universe.  
It is a temporary EFT phase with strict entry and exit conditions.

---

## Termination

If cutoff, observables, or exit are undefined → inflation execution halts.

# Holographic Projection Framework (HPF)

This repository contains the **canonical specification, regulatory architecture, and supporting analyses** for the **Holographic Projection Framework (HPF)** and its associated systems.

HPF is a **finite-resolution, information-theoretic framework for physics** that enforces **saturation, reversibility, and regime legality** across scales.

## Canonical Documents — *Authority Surface*

These files **define meaning, symbols, and executable semantics**.
Anything outside this set **may not redefine primitives**.

### Primary Texts

* **`HPF.md`**
  *The HPF White Paper*
  Defines axioms, constraints, and falsifiable claims.

* **`UHET.md`**
  *Unified Holographic Entropy Theory*
  Entropy, saturation, and resolution as governing constraints.

* **`QPRCA.md`**
  *Quantum-Projection Regulated Causal Architecture*
  Causal locality, projection rules, and geometric health.

* **`MDEA-HPF.md`**
  *Multi-Domain Execution Architecture under HPF*
  How physical regimes are routed and handed off without singularities.

* **`EFT Ladder-HPF Backbone Routing Entry.md`**
  The canonical execution backbone.
  All effective field theories must attach to or hand off through this ladder.

* **`Symbol_index.md`**
  **Canonical translation layer**.
  Defines all symbols and notation used across primary texts.

## Regulations — *Theory Legality & Applicability*

### `Regulations/`

Contains **regulatory entries for individual physical theories**.

Each regulation specifies:

* execution legality under HPF
* resolution and saturation constraints
* routing and handoff conditions
* failure and override behavior

Regulations **do not define theory** — they **govern when and how a theory may execute** under HPF.

**Examples include:**

* General Relativity (GR) regulation entries
* QFT / EFT regulation entries
* AdS/CFT applicability entries
* Semiclassical gravity handoffs

## Supporting Documentation — *Explanatory & Evidentiary*

### `Supporting_Docs/`

Documents that **support, elaborate, or test** the canonical framework.

Includes:

* update and evolution dynamics
* gravity metrics
* entropy phase behavior
* empirical calibration
* numerical demonstrations

These documents **must defer to the canonical texts and the Symbol Index**.

### `Supporting_Docs/Regulation/` *(if present)*

Human-readable regulatory explanations derived from the formal regulation entries.

---

## Python Toy Models — *Non-Authoritative*

### `python_toy_models/`

Exploratory and illustrative Python scripts.

These are **demonstrations only** and are **not part of the formal framework**.

---

## Library — *Appendices & Extracts*

### `Library/`

Public appendices, regulated dualities, and extracted reference material.
Includes minimal public extracts of internal appendices.

---

## Archive — *Historical / Non-Authoritative*

### `Archive/`

Superseded drafts, legacy simulations, and historical artifacts.
Retained for transparency only.

---

## Media

### `pictures/`

Figures and plots referenced by supporting documents.

## Authority Rule (Explicit)

> **Only root-level canonical documents define HPF, UHET, QPRCA, MDEA, and the EFT Ladder.**
> Regulations govern applicability.
> Supporting documents explain and test.
> Toy models illustrate only.

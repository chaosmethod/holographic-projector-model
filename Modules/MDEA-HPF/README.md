# MDEA-HPF  
**Multi-Domain Execution Architecture regulated by the Holographic Projection Framework**

---

## Overview

**MDEA-HPF** is a **multi-domain execution architecture** designed to orchestrate physical evolution across classical, relativistic, semiclassical, quantum, and pre-geometric regimes.

It is **regulated by HPF (Holographic Projection Framework)**, which provides legality detection, regime routing, and hard execution gates. HPF does *not* evolve physical state. MDEA does.

This module implements the **execution layer**, not the legality framework itself.

## Conceptual Separation

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-----|---------------|
| **HPF (Framework)** | Detects regime legality, enforces hard gates, decides *when* execution must change |
| **MDEA (Architecture)** | Executes domain experts, manages handoffs, and orchestrates evolution |

> **Key rule:**  
> HPF determines *what is allowed*.  
> MDEA determines *what runs next*.

## Architecture Summary

- **Domain Experts**  
  - Classical Mechanics  
  - General Relativity (GR)  
  - Semiclassical Gravity  
  - Quantum Field Theory (QFT)  
  - UHET (Ultra-High Energy Transition handler)  
  - QPRCA (Quantum Pre-Geometric substrate)

- **HPF Regulation Layer**
  - Monitors legality signals:
    - Geometry health `G`
    - Saturation pressure `σ`
    - Resolution convergence `conv`
    - Instability migration `mig`
  - Enforces hard gates:
    - `σ > 1` → UHET
    - `G < G_crit` → QPRCA

- **MDEA Execution Layer**
  - Selects and runs the highest-validity domain expert
  - Performs explicit state handoffs
  - Preserves conserved quantities and uncertainty
  - Forbids invented precision

## What This Module Is *Not*

- ❌ Not a new physical theory  
- ❌ Not a replacement for GR, QFT, or QM  
- ❌ Not a quantum gravity proposal  

This module is an **execution architecture**.

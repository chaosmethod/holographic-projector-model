# Modified Gravity (MOND / TeVeS) — HPF Routing Entry

## Status
Conditionally executable as low-energy EFT modifications.

---

## Required EFT attachment

MOND / TeVeS must:
- specify modified operators in gravitational EFT
- define validity scale (typically galactic / IR)
- preserve observable mapping (rotation curves, lensing)

No standalone geometric authority is granted.

---

## Hard legality gates

- **Scale restriction enforced**  
  Claims beyond declared IR domain → authority collapse.

- **Relativistic completion clarity**  
  Any relativistic extension must itself obey EFT legality.

- **Cosmology compatibility declared**  
  If incompatible with $\Lambda$ CDM regimes, handoff must be specified.

---

## Handoff points

- **Upward (UV)**  
  Must recover GR + standard EFT at higher accelerations / energies.

- **Downward (IR)**  
  May hand off to phenomenological galactic dynamics.

Failure to recover GR in the appropriate regime → blocked.

---

## Interpretation under HPF

MOND-like theories are treated as effective IR corrections, not alternative fundamentals.

---

## Termination

If regime boundaries blur or observables fail → execution halts.

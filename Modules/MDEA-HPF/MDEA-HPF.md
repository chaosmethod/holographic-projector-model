# **MDEA‑HPF**  
### **Multi‑Domain Execution Architecture Regulated by the Holographic Projection Framework**  
### **for Gravitational Collapse and Evaporation**

---

## **Abstract**

I introduce **MDEA‑HPF**, a Multi‑Domain Execution Architecture regulated by the **Holographic Projection Framework (HPF)**.  
HPF is *not* a new fundamental theory. Instead, it functions as a **domain‑agnostic legality and regime‑detection layer** that governs execution within MDEA‑HPF.

Physical evolution is routed to the appropriate domain expert based on **computable signals**, including:

- geometry health  
- saturation pressure  
- resolution convergence  
- instability migration  

This mixture‑of‑experts architecture enables a **continuous, non‑singular operational description** of the gravitational  
$$\text{collapse} \;\rightarrow\; \text{horizon formation} \;\rightarrow\; \text{evaporation}$$  
sequence.

## **1. Introduction**

No existing physical theory provides a complete dynamical description of gravitational collapse and subsequent evaporation:

- **General Relativity (GR)** predicts singularities where its smooth‑geometry assumptions fail.  
- **Semiclassical gravity** breaks down under strong backreaction and geometry branching.  
- **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)** presupposes a fixed background spacetime.

MDEA‑HPF addresses this by introducing **HPF as a legality and regime‑routing regulator**.  
HPF evaluates domain‑agnostic signals and governs when execution must transition between domain experts, producing a **non‑singular operational description** of multi‑regime gravitational dynamics.

---

## **2. Architecture Overview**

MDEA‑HPF separates responsibilities into two layers:

### **HPF — Regulation Layer**
- Detects regime legality  
- Enforces execution constraints  
- Determines when handoffs are required  

### **MDEA — Execution Layer**
- Orchestrates execution among domain experts  
- Performs explicit state handoffs  

### **Core Principle**
HPF enforces execution legality and triggers regime routing when a domain’s assumptions fail.

| Rule | Condition | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Non‑Engagement** | Refinement removes instability without new structure | Incumbent domain continues execution |
| **Engagement** | Instability persists or migrates across scales | HPF engages and constrains execution |

---

## **3. Formal Vocabulary**

- **Domain Expert** $E_i$ — A theory + solver valid within a defined regime  
- **Validity Envelope** — Dimensionless conditions required for a domain to remain legal  
- **Hard Gate** — Non‑negotiable routing condition (e.g., saturation or geometry failure)  
- **Handoff State** — Minimal exported state for regime transition, preserving conserved quantities and forbidding invented precision  

---

## **4. HPF Control Signals**

### **4.1 Resolution Convergence**

Let $b(x)$ be a local badness field:

$$
B = \sum_x b(x)
$$

Convergence holds if refinement yields:

$$
\frac{B_{\text{ref}}}{B_{\text{base}}} \le \tau_C
\qquad (\tau_C = 0.5 \text{ default})
$$

---

### **4.2 Instability Migration**

Migration holds if irreversibility persists *and relocates* under refinement.

**Persistence:**

$$
\frac{B_{\text{ref}}}{B_{\text{base}}} \ge \tau_P
\qquad (\tau_P = 0.8)
$$

**Relocation:**  
Either the center‑of‑mass of $b(x)$ or the concentration radius $R_{90}$ shifts beyond a threshold.

---

### **4.3 Saturation Pressure**

Defined as:

$$
\sigma(x) = \frac{\text{update demand}(x)}{\text{update capacity}(x)}
$$

Interpretation:

- $\sigma \ll 1$ — Uncongested  
- $\sigma \approx 1$ — Near saturation  
- $\sigma > 1$ — **Illegal (Hard Gate)**  

Aggregate:

$$
\sigma_{\max} = \max_x \sigma(x)
$$

---

### **4.4 Health Metrics**

**Geometry Health:**

$$
G_{\text{health}} \in [0,1], \qquad G_{\text{crit}} = 0.3
$$

**Unitarity Health:**

$$
U_{\text{health}} \in [0,1]
$$

---

## **5. Routing Logic**

### **Stage A — Hard Gate (Activation)**

HPF remains **inactive** if:

$$
\text{conv} = \text{true}, \qquad
\text{mig} = \text{false}, \qquad
\sigma_{\max} < \sigma_* \quad (\sigma_* = 0.7)
$$

HPF **activates** if:

$$
\text{mig} = \text{true}
\quad\text{or}\quad
\sigma_{\max} \ge \sigma_* \text{ persistently}
$$

### **Override Routes**

- If $\sigma_{\max} > 1$ → **UHET**  
- If $G_{\text{health}} < G_{\text{crit}}$ → **QPRCA**

---

### **Stage B — Soft Selection**

Among legal experts $E_i$:

$$
E^* = \arg\max_i \; E_i.\text{validity}(\text{state}, \text{signals})
$$

---

### **5.1 — Override Precedence (Simultaneous Hard-Gate Triggers)**

When multiple hard-gate triggers fire in the same region/time window, HPF applies the following precedence ordering:

1. **Geometry Failure dominates execution authority**
   $[
   G_{\text{health}} < G_{\text{crit}} ;\Rightarrow; \textbf{route to QPRCA}
   ]$
   Rationale: metric / semiclassical execution is illegal when geometry interpretation fails.

2. **Saturation enforces constraints inside the active executor**
   $[
   \sigma_{\max} > 1 ;\Rightarrow; \textbf{apply saturation throttling / queuing constraints}
   ]$
   If $(G_{\text{health}} \ge G_{\text{crit}})$, the executor may be UHET.
   If $(G_{\text{health}} < G_{\text{crit}})$, saturation constraints are enforced **within QPRCA execution** (update throttling, reversible redistribution), not by selecting UHET as the executor.

3. **Information-flow overload is treated as a routing event**
   If entanglement / coherence load exceeds locally maintainable bandwidth, HPF forces **state partitioning** (measurement-as-routing) while preserving reversibility via redistribution into uncontrolled degrees of freedom.

Operationally, in priority order:

Deterministic Override Ordering

Override conditions are evaluated in the following sequence:

Geometry Integrity Check

If $𝐺health<𝐺critGhealth<Gcrit$
	​
execution transitions to QPRCA.

Saturation Check

If $𝐺health≥𝐺critand𝜎max>1Ghealth≥Gcritandσmax>1$

execution transitions to UHET.

Otherwise

Proceed to Stage B soft selection among valid experts.

Independent Saturation Enforcement

Whenever

𝜎
max
⁡
>
1
σ
max
	​

>1

saturation constraints (throttling / reversible redistribution) are applied to the active executor, regardless of which expert is currently executing.

This patch is consistent with your existing hard overrides and legality signals in `MDEA-HPF.md`.

## **6. Application: Regulated Collapse and Evaporation**

### **Classical Collapse**
- $G_{\text{health}} \approx 1$  
- HPF inactive  
- GR dominates  

### **Horizon Formation**
- $\sigma_{\max} \gtrsim \sigma_*$  
- HPF activates and constrains execution  

### **Semiclassical Regime**
- Irreversibility persists  
- Semiclassical gravity selected  

### **Saturation (UHET)**
- If $\sigma_{\max} > 1$, HPF routes to **UHET**  
- Throttling + entropy budgeting enforced  

### **Metric Failure (QPRCA)**
- If $G_{\text{health}} < G_{\text{crit}}$, HPF routes to **QPRCA**  
- Singularities avoided by forbidding illegal metric execution  

### **Re‑Emergence**
As curvature decreases:

- $G_{\text{health}} \to 1$  
- HPF disengages  
- Execution transitions back to QFT → Classical Physics  

---

## **7. Discussion and Conclusion**

MDEA‑HPF formalizes heuristic regime transitions into an explicit execution architecture governed by **computable legality signals**.  
Singularities are avoided not by modifying underlying equations, but by **forbidding illegal execution**.

This provides a rigorous runtime framework for multi‑regime gravitational dynamics compatible with existing effective field theories.

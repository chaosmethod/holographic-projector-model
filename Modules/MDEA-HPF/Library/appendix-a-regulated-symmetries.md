Appendix A — Regulated Symmetries
Purpose
This appendix specifies how symmetries (gauge, spacetime, internal) are treated under HPF legality and MDEA authority assignment.
Symmetries are treated as emergent constraints, not inviolable axioms.

General Rule
A symmetry SSS is enforceable iff:
It is supported by resolved degrees of freedom

It does not require infinite resolution

It does not override HPF hard gates

Its enforcement does not conceal instability or saturation

Symmetries do not execute; they constrain execution.

Authority Model for Symmetries
Each symmetry is assigned contextual authority:
$vS=fresolution⋅fstability⋅funiversalityvS∈[0,1]v_S = f_{\text{resolution}} \cdot f_{\text{stability}} \cdot f_{\text{universality}} \qquad v_S \in [0,1]vS​=fresolution​⋅fstability​⋅funiversality​vS​∈[0,1]$
Where:
$fresolutionf_{\text{resolution}}fresolution$​: symmetry respected by available resolution

$fstabilityf_{\text{stability}}fstability$​: symmetry persists under refinement

$funiversalityf_{\text{universality}}funiversality$​: symmetry applies across active channels


Regulated Symmetry Classes
Gauge Symmetries (U(1), SU(2), SU(3))
Status: ✅ Conditionally enforceable

Authority: High in low-saturation, well-resolved regimes

Failure mode: operator proliferation, strong coupling

Action: authority decays; EFT handoff enforced


Lorentz / Diffeomorphism Symmetry
Status: ✅ Emergent, not fundamental

Authority: High when $Ghealth≈1G_{\text{health}}\approx1Ghealth​≈1$

Failure mode: congestion, lattice scale, geometry degradation

Action: treated as approximate; preferred update frame may emerge


Exact / Global Symmetries
Status: ⚠️ Rarely absolute

Failure mode: broken by UV completion or saturation

Action: never allowed to block routing or overrides


Execution Prohibitions
Under HPF:
No symmetry may override $σmax⁡>1\sigma_{\max}>1σmax​>1 or Ghealth<GcritG_{\text{health}}<G_{\text{crit}}Ghealth​<Gcrit$​

No symmetry may be enforced beyond resolved scale

No symmetry is assumed exact across regimes


Appendix Verdict
Symmetries are contextual constraints, enforced only while legal.
 They fade, not fail.

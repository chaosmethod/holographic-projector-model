**Appendix F — Minimal Public Extract**
Purpose
This appendix provides a public-safe, non-confrontational summary of MDEA-HPF suitable for casual inspection without triggering sociological defense mechanisms.

One-Paragraph Summary
MDEA-HPF is a regime-aware execution architecture for physics.
It does not replace existing theories.
Instead, it provides a formal mechanism for determining when physical descriptions are applicable, how much authority they should have, and when transitions are required.
The framework enforces finite resolution, explicit failure modes, and conservative handoffs between domains such as classical gravity, quantum field theory, and pre-geometric models.

Core Principles (Public-Safe)
Physics descriptions are context-limited

Finite resolution matters

Singularities indicate illegal execution, not physical infinities

Transitions between regimes should be explicit, not heuristic



What It Does Not Claim
It is not a theory of everything

It does not falsify existing frameworks

It does not assume a specific microscopic substrate

It does not override observational physics



Why It’s Useful
Clarifies domain boundaries

Prevents extrapolation errors

Makes regime transitions explicit

Encourages falsifiability over ideology



Closing Line (Intentional Tone)
MDEA-HPF is best understood as execution governance for multi-regime physics, analogous to how numerical solvers enforce stability without changing underlying equations.

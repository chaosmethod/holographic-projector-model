**Appendix B — Regulated Observables**

Purpose

This appendix defines what qualifies as an operational observable under HPF, and how observability gates execution authority.

Observables are inputs to legality, not byproducts of theory.



General Rule

A quantity OOO is an observable if:

It can be operationally defined



It is stable under refinement



It does not require invented precision



It does not depend on illegal execution assumptions



Unobservable quantities cannot justify authority.



Observable Health Metric

Each observable is assigned a stability score:

HO=fdefinition⋅frefinement⋅fresolutionHO∈\[0,1]H\_O = f\_{\\text{definition}} \\cdot f\_{\\text{refinement}} \\cdot f\_{\\text{resolution}} \\qquad H\_O \\in \[0,1]HO​=fdefinition​⋅frefinement​⋅fresolution​HO​∈\[0,1]

Observables with HO≪1H\_O \\ll 1HO​≪1 are excluded from routing decisions.



Observable Classes

Direct Observables

Examples: arrival times, cross sections, fluxes

Status: ✅ Fully admissible



Use: primary routing anchors





Derived Observables

Examples: reconstructed metrics, effective potentials

Status: ⚠️ Conditionally admissible



Use: allowed only within validity envelope





Non-Operational Quantities

Examples: landscape averages, unmeasurable moduli

Status: ❌ Non-admissible



Use: never affect routing or authority





Execution Prohibitions

Under HPF:

No theory gains authority from unobservable structure



No observable may be stabilized by assumption



Duality-only quantities require anchored side





Appendix Verdict

Observables are currency in MDEA-HPF.

 If it can’t be cashed, it can’t be spent.

HPF Applicability Test: Resolution Migration Test (RMT)
Purpose

This appendix defines the Resolution Migration Test (RMT), a diagnostic used to determine whether HPF legality and MDEA authority assignment meaningfully apply to a given system or theory.

The RMT is a precondition check, not a verdict.

Applicability Rule

A system is subject to HPF regulation iff:

It exhibits resolution-dependent behavior

Its effective degrees of freedom migrate under refinement

Its execution or prediction depends on bounded informational capacity

Systems failing all three conditions are outside HPF scope.

Resolution Migration Test (RMT)

A system passes the RMT if, under refinement:

Active degrees of freedom change or proliferate

Authority migrates between descriptive layers

Predictions depend on resolution scale

A system fails the RMT if refinement produces no material change in execution or authority.

Classification Outcomes

HPF-Active

Resolution migration present

Authority must be assigned and tracked

HPF legality gates apply

HPF-Native

System already enforces finite resolution and handoff

HPF introduces no new constraints

Authority remains stable under refinement

HPF-Inactive

No meaningful resolution dependence

No authority migration

HPF does not engage

Diagnostic Notes

Passing the RMT does not imply executability

Failing the RMT does not imply invalidity

The RMT only determines whether HPF regulation is relevant

Appendix Verdict

The Resolution Migration Test determines scope, not outcome.

HPF applies only where resolution migration exists.

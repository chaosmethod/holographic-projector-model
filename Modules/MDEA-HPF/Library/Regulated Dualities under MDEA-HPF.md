Regulated Dualities under MDEA-HPF
Purpose

This appendix specifies how duality constructions are treated under HPF legality and MDEA authority assignment.

Dualities are treated as relational mappings, not equivalences of execution.

General Rule

A duality $D$ is admissible iff:

Both sides are independently legal under HPF

The mapping does not require invented precision

Authority does not increase under translation

The duality does not conceal saturation or instability

Dualities do not execute; they relate executions.

Authority Behavior for Dualities

Dualities inherit authority from their weakest side.

If either representation loses legality, the duality collapses.

Authority is never amplified by duality.

Regulated Duality Classes

Holographic Dualities (e.g., AdS/CFT)
Status: ✅ Conditionally admissible

Boundary representation may dominate when operationally anchored

Bulk authority collapses without resolved reconstruction

No duality survives loss of boundary observables

Strong / Weak Coupling Dualities
Status: ⚠️ Contextual

Valid only within overlapping legal windows

Authority migrates with coupling scale

No protection against saturation or overrides

Background / Pre-Geometric Dualities
Status: ❌ Non-executable

No shared observable basis

No legal authority transfer

Treated as heuristic correspondences only

Execution Prohibitions

Under HPF:

No duality may override $\sigma_{\max} > 1$

No duality may override $G_{\text{health}} < G_{\text{crit}}$

No duality may block UHET or QPRCA engagement

No duality may substitute for explicit handoff

Appendix Verdict

Dualities are interpretive bridges, not execution guarantees.

They persist only while both sides remain legal.

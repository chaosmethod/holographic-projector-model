## Status

Primary execution backbone under HPF.

All regime-level theories must attach to or hand off from the EFT ladder to remain legal.

---

## Definition (HPF sense)

The **EFT ladder** is a stack of finite-resolution execution layers (“rungs”), each defined by:

- cutoff scale $\Lambda$
- active degrees of freedom
- allowed operators
- operational observables
- explicit exit / handoff condition

It is **not** a claim of fundamentality.

It is a **scheduler spine**.

---

## Hard legality gates (always enforced)

### Finite cutoff declared
$\Lambda$ must be explicit and finite.

### Observable completeness
All retained operators must map to measurable quantities within the rung.

### Resolution legality
$\sigma(\Lambda) < 1$

If violated → authority collapse.

### Explicit handoff declared
Every rung must specify:
- upward handoff (UV failure)
- downward handoff (IR emergence)

No rung is allowed to run indefinitely.

---

## Authority behavior

- Authority is local to a rung
- Authority decays near cutoff
- Authority collapses at saturation
- Authority does not propagate across rungs without declaration

There is **no global EFT authority**.

---

## Interpretation under HPF

EFT is the only framework natively compatible with HPF legality due to:

- finite resolution
- explicit scope
- observable discipline
- honest failure modes

As a result, it functions as the **default execution substrate**, not as a fundamental theory.

---

## Routing rules

Any framework claiming physical relevance must answer:

1. Which EFT rung do you attach to?
2. What operators do you modify or generate?
3. At what scale does your authority end?
4. Where do you hand off when it does?

Failure to answer any of the above → execution blocked.

---

## Black hole handling

### Exterior
EFT valid until curvature or resolution saturation.

### Near-horizon
Authority decays; higher-curvature operators tracked.

### Interior / saturation
$\sigma \to 1$ → EFT execution halts.

Mandatory handoff to a non-EFT regulated domain.

No EFT continuation past saturation is legal.

---

## Termination

The EFT ladder never “wins.”

It routes or stops.

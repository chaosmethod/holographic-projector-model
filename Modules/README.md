# HPF Modules

This directory contains the executable and theoretical components of the
Holographic Projection Framework (HPF), organized as a conditional stack:

HPF (Regulatory Layer)
→ UHET (Entropy / Saturation Limits)
→ QPRCA (Reversible Microdynamics)

HPF is engaged only in regimes where increased resolution fails to eliminate
irreversibility, indicating emergent rather than fundamental structure.

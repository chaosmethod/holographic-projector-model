The Holographic Projector Framework (HPF) v8.0 is a resolution-limited, information-theoretic model in which spacetime, matter, and gauge structure emerge from discrete holographic projection. 
HPF v8.0 consolidates derivations of finite resolution from entropy bounds, reversible lattice updates, exponential saturation dynamics, fermion generation stability, gauge group emergence, and dark energy magnitude. 
The framework is structured as axioms, lemmas, conditional theorems, and observational corollaries, with explicit falsifiability criteria. 
HPF v8.0 is presented as a constructive research program in fundamental physics, without claims of finality, allowing experimental results and peer review to determine its scope.

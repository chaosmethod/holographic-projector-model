[Open Source] The Holographic Projector Model (v5.0) - A Computational Unification of Gravity and Dark Energy
This framework posits that the observable universe is a **Holographic Projection** generated by a distributed computational process. By treating Spacetime not as a fundamental background but as an emergent **Data Processing Grid**, the model unifies General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

* **Gravity** is re-derived as **Processing Latency**.
* **Quantum Mechanics** is re-derived as **Resource Optimization** (Lazy Loading).
* **Dark Energy** is re-derived as the **Thermodynamic Cost** of information storage, governed by the Bekenstein-Hawking Bound.

## 1. Fundamental Primitives (The Kernel)

The model rests on three irreducible primitives that bootstrap the physical simulation.

1.  **Time (The Throne):** The fundamental System Clock. It is the sequence processor that dictates causality. The speed of light ($c$) is defined not as a velocity, but as the **Maximum Clock Rate** of the processor.
2.  **Light (The King):** The fundamental Data Type. Massless instruction code that executes at the native processor speed ($c$).
3.  **The Bootstrap Loop:** A self-referential cycle where the "Zip File" (Black Hole) encodes the instructions to build the "Unpacker" (White Hole), which runs to generate the next Zip File.

> **The Initialization Logic:** A closed loop represents a logical deadlock (Halting Problem). The system resolves this via an **External Interrupt** (Boundary Condition) at $t=0$, creating an Arrow of Time that functions as a thermodynamic heat engine, exporting entropy to a meta-environment.

I present the Holographic Projection Framework (HPF), a set of axioms and derivations that consolidate necessity arguments for finite resolution from entropy bounds, reversible update bandwidth, and causal locality.
HPF provides a discrete informational foundation distinct from continuum quantum field theory, resolving singularities and reframing unitarity as a lattice-enforced constraint.
The framework yields falsifiable departures from classical continuum general relativity, including a specific mechanism for gauge group selection via bandwidth truncation, resolution saturation effects at horizons, and irreducible stochastic jitter.
## The HPF Signature

The **Zeta Stability Function** defines reality as a bandwidth-limited probability:

$$
\zeta(S_f) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{k(S_f - \lambda)}}
$$

| Symbol | Definition | Context |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| $S_f$ | Information Flux Ratio | Input Density / Capacity Limit (Dimensionless) |
| $\lambda^\*$ | **Lu Terminal Threshold** | Entropy-phase collapse boundary where geometric support fails (≈ 5.7889) |
| $\lambda_{\text{engine}}$ | **Operational Lu Threshold** | Early saturation / blur pivot used by entropy engine (≪ $\lambda^\*$) |
| $k$ | Rendering Slope | Controls transition sharpness between laminar and turbulent regimes |
> *“Flux saturation determines what persists and what jitters.”*

`Derived modules explore specific consequences of HPF (e.g., gravity, EM propagation). They are logically downstream of the core framework and may be evaluated independently.`

I present the Holographic Projection Framework (HPF), a set of axioms and derivations that consolidate necessity arguments for finite resolution from entropy bounds, reversible update bandwidth, and causal locality. HPF provides a discrete informational foundation distinct from continuum quantum field theory, resolving singularities and reframing unitarity as a lattice-enforced constraint. The framework yields falsifiable departures from classical continuum general relativity, including a specific mechanism for gauge group selection via bandwidth truncation, resolution saturation effects at horizons, and irreducible stochastic jitter.

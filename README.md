I present the Holographic Projection Framework (HPF), a set of axioms and derivations that consolidate necessity arguments for finite resolution from entropy bounds, reversible update bandwidth, and causal locality.
HPF provides a discrete informational foundation distinct from continuum quantum field theory, resolving singularities and reframing unitarity as a lattice-enforced constraint.
The framework yields falsifiable departures from classical continuum general relativity, including a specific mechanism for gauge group selection via bandwidth truncation, resolution saturation effects at horizons, and irreducible stochastic jitter.
## The HPF Signature

The **Zeta Stability Function** defines reality as a bandwidth-limited probability:

$$
\zeta(S_f) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{k(S_f - \lambda)}}
$$

| Symbol | Definition | Context |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| $S_f$ | Information Flux Ratio | Input Density / Capacity Limit (Dimensionless) |
| $S_f$ | **Information Flux** | The "Reynolds Number" of spacetime |
| $\lambda$ | **The Lu Threshold** | The bandwidth limit where geometry fails |

> *“Flux saturation determines what persists and what jitters.”*

**Appendix E — Regulated Time**
(Scheduler Time vs Proper Time)
Purpose
This appendix distinguishes time as experienced from time as executed, and specifies how time is regulated under HPF.
Time is treated as an emergent rate, not a fundamental parameter.

Two Time Variables
Scheduler Time $tschedt\_{\\text{sched}}tsched$​
Global execution clock

Counts discrete update cycles

Never dilates

Not directly observable



Proper Time $τ(x)\\tau(x)τ(x)$
Locally experienced time

Emerges from update availability

Observable via physical processes



Emergence Relation
Local proper time is regulated by update availability:
$dτ(x)dtsched∝α(x)\\frac{d\\tau(x)}{dt\_{\\text{sched}}} \\propto \\sqrt{\\alpha(x)}dtsched​dτ(x)​∝α(x)$​
 Where:
$α(x)\\alpha(x)α(x)$ is local coherent update availability

congestion reduces experienced time rate



Consequences
This yields:
gravitational time dilation

redshift

horizon formation

effective causal slowdown

No spacetime metric is assumed at the substrate level.

Failure Modes
As $α→0\\alpha \\to 0α→0$: time effectively freezes (horizon-like behavior)

If geometry interpretation fails: time remains defined via scheduler flow

Time never becomes undefined — only reinterpreted.

Appendix Verdict
Time is regulated throughput, not a primitive.
Geometry describes it after the fact.

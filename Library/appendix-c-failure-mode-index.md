**Appendix C — Failure-Mode Index**
Purpose
This appendix catalogs common execution failure modes that trigger HPF engagement, authority decay, or hard overrides.
Failure modes are expected, not exceptional.

Canonical Failure Modes
FM-1: Invented Precision
Signal: claims exceed resolution support

Action: authority collapse

Common in: UV extrapolations, string constructions



FM-2: Missing Observables
Signal: no operational anchor

Action: expert blocked

Common in: pre-geometric frameworks



FM-3: Instability Migration
Signal: badness persists and relocates under refinement

Action: HPF engagement, rerouting

Common in: semiclassical backreaction limits



FM-4: Saturation
Signal: $σmax⁡>1\\sigma\_{\\max}>1σmax​>1$

Action: UHET override

Common in: extreme EM compactness, collapse



FM-5: Geometry Failure
Signal: $Ghealth<0.3G\_{\\text{health}}<0.3Ghealth​<0.3$

Action: QPRCA override

Common in: singularity-approach regimes



Design Principle

-If multiple failure modes are active, Geometry Failure takes precedence over Saturation in executor selection.-

No failure mode is allowed to:
propagate silently

be “interpreted away”

be patched by extending authority

Failures terminate or reroute execution.

Appendix Verdict
Failure modes are first-class signals.
Ignoring them is illegal execution.

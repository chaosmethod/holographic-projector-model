**Appendix D — Regulated Information Flow**
(Entanglement, Decoherence, Measurement)
Purpose
This appendix specifies how quantum information flow is regulated under HPF legality and MDEA authority assignment.
Information flow is treated as a physical execution cost, not an abstract bookkeeping device.

General Rule
An information process III is legally executable iff:
Information transfer is locally bounded

Entanglement does not require nonlocal invented coordination

Decoherence arises from environmental coupling, not fiat

No HPF hard gate is violated

Information may be preserved, throttled, or partitioned, but never destroyed.

Regulated Quantities
Entanglement Load
Entanglement contributes to local update pressure:
$Lent(x)⊂Ltot(x)L\_{\\text{ent}}(x) \\subset L\_{\\text{tot}}(x)Lent​(x)⊂Ltot​(x)$
Entanglement is not free; it consumes coherent update capacity.

Decoherence
Decoherence is treated as:
redistribution of phase information into uncontrolled degrees of freedom

not collapse

not fundamental irreversibility

Decoherence rate increases as:
environmental coupling increases

available coherent update bandwidth decreases



Measurement
Measurement is a routing event, not a postulate.
Measurement occurs when:
entanglement load exceeds locally maintainable coherence

HPF forces state partitioning to preserve reversibility

No preferred observer is assumed.

Execution Prohibitions
Under HPF:
No superluminal information transfer

No observer-induced collapse axioms

No global wavefunction control without bandwidth accounting



Appendix Verdict
Quantum information flow is regulated execution, not metaphysics.
Entanglement persists while affordable.
Decoherence occurs when it is not.
